Q2 : int *p, q;        
p is a pointer and q is an integer.
p and q both are pointers.
P and q both are integers.
Syntax is incorrect.

Answer is : p is a pointer and q is and integer

Q3: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;            Here ptr get the address of a
b = *ptr + 1;             Here b gets the value of a+1 that is 11
ptr = &b;                 Here ptr gets update by address of b
cout << *ptr <<" "<< a <<" "<< b;
11 11 10
10 10 10
11 10 11
10 11 10

Output is: 11 10 11

Q4: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;         Here ptr gets the addres of a
int *ptr2 = &b;        Here ptr2 gets the address of b
*ptr = *ptr2;           Here by pointer ptr the value in a gets upadate by the value b


ptr now points to b
ptr2 now points to a
a gets value of b
b gets value of a


Answer is: A gets value of B

Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?

int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;  Here we define the pointer but we don'nt know what address it is storing (Garbage)
*ptr = 5;    Here we add the 5 into garbage address

Asnser is : we can write it but it make no sense of writing it
